# IAM Cloud Governance Lab 

A hands-on cloud governance project demonstrating identity lifecycle management, access controls, and audit-ready IAM practices in AWS.

---

## Project Overview

This project simulates how a security GRC and cloud governance team designs, documents, and validates Identity and Access Management (IAM) controls in a cloud-based environment.

The lab focuses on **governance, risk, and compliance outcomes**, not just technical configuration. It demonstrates how IAM controls are aligned to industry frameworks and prepared for audit and regulatory review.

---

## Objectives

- Design least-privilege IAM roles aligned with business functions
- Implement identity lifecycle controls (joiner, mover, leaver)
- Document IAM controls mapped to security frameworks
- Produce audit-ready evidence for access governance

---

## Scope

- **Cloud Platform:** AWS  
- **Identity Focus:** Human and service identities  

### Control Areas
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Privileged access management concepts
- Access reviews and recertification
- Logging and monitoring for IAM activity

---

## Framework Alignment

This project aligns IAM controls to the following frameworks:

- **NIST SP 800-53** (AC, IA, AU families)
- **ISO/IEC 27001** Annex A (A.5, A.8, A.9)
- **SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria** (CC6, CC7)

---

## Governance Artifacts Produced

- IAM role definitions with business justification
- Access review and recertification checklist
- Control mapping matrix (IAM → framework controls)
- Sample audit evidence package

---

## Why This Project Matters

Strong IAM governance is foundational to cloud security, compliance, and risk management. This project demonstrates the ability to:

- Translate security frameworks into operational controls
- Balance security requirements with business needs
- Communicate IAM risk and control effectiveness to both technical and non-technical stakeholders
